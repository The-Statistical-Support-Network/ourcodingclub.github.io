	<h3>Gergana Daskalova</h3>
	<p>I am a global change ecologist with a passion for biodiversity change, agro-ecology and quantitative syntheses. The overarching aim of my research is to determine what are the sources of the complex patterns of population and biodiversity change observed over time around the world. From forest cover change around the world to climate warming in the Arctic and more, I am investigating how and why Earth’s biota is changing across the Anthropocene. In the last five years, Coding Club has brought me so much joy and I have loved creating tutorials, running workshops and seeing our team grow. For more, check out <a href="https://gndaskalova.com/" target="_blank">my personal website</a> and Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/gndaskalova" target="_blank">@gndaskalova</a>. I am part of the <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NERC E3 Doctoral Training Programme</a> at the University of Edinburgh and I'm also a <a href="http://www.carnegie-trust.org/carnegiephdscholars2017/gergana-daskalova" target="_blank">Carnegie scholar, now in my final year!</a></p>

	<h3>Elise Gallois</h3>
	<p>I’m a 3rd Year E4 DTP PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, studying the effects of microclimate on various aspects Arctic tundra ecology. For this project I’m busy analyzing time series data, spatial data, as well as analyzing data from multiple different sources. Throughout this process I’ve found that Coding Club tutorials have given me the skillset and confident to tackle these challenges, and I really love being able to pass on these skills to others as a tutor. My favourite thing about Coding Club is watching people with no experience in coding build up their confidence and ability to solve their own unique coding and statistical challenges. You can find me here: <a href="https://www.elisegallois.com/" target="_blank">https://www.elisegallois.com/</a>, and on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/e_gallois" target="_blank">@e_gallois</a>.</p>

	<h3>Colombe Stevens</h3>
	<p>I am an undergraduate Ecology & Environmental Sciences student at the University of Edinburgh. My interests are quite varied: agri-food systems, anything to do with subarctic and polar ecosystems and relating ecology to the human world and its sustainability challenges. I first started out on R by going to a few Coding Club sessions in 2019 and then fully bit the bullet by taking the Data Science in Ecology and Environmental Sciences course in my 3rd year. Although I never envisioned myself coding, I have now become a convert and actually find it to be quite a soothing and therapeutic kind of work (past me would have never guessed this)! I look forward to exploring more of the coding world and am excited to be a Coding Club tutor and to share with this community!</p>

	<p>I am a 4th year undergraduate student of Ecological and Environmental Sciences at the University of Edinburgh. My interests in my field are wide, from animal behaviour, using remote sensing to answer some environmental questions, climate change, marine biology....  You would usually find me checking weather channels because I am obsessed with weather! My data science journey started with using some basic R in 2019, but really started with a Data Science course in my 3rd year. I found coding and statistics very complicated at the beginning, and as a complete math amateur I never thought coding was actually so intuitive and could be so much fun and could make your life easier! Apart from my studies, I am a yoga teacher, a passionate diver and foreign languages enthusiast.</p>
